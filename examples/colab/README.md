# colab

Run these jupyter notebooks on google colab by clicking the botton on top.
Or just copy and paste it to your colab environment.

You don't need to install additional python packages, not even the `requirements.txt` in the root directory of this repo. Everything can be handled in the scripts in the cloud.
